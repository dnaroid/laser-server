France has accused activists of inciting unrest. The interior ministry says militants calling themselves “No Borders” which is a far-left group that opposes border controls, are exploiting the misery of migrants and encouraging them to riot and to commit violence against the police.

Pouring cold water on foreign reports that a bomb caused last week’s airliner disaster, Cairo insists that any such conclusion is premature.

Sharm el-Sheikh, fondly dubbed one of Egyptian tourism’s crown jewels, is the country’s number one destination for Russians and Britons.

Many livelihoods depend on them. Russians make up around one third of all tourists to Egypt.

One Russian holiday-maker told euronews what her stay so far had been like: “…Not very pleasant. We were very worried at first. We had planned this holiday in advance and what happened frightened us. But then we talked to the travel agent and he calmed us down.”

We can see that Sharm still has tourists from various countries, some of whom went ahead with their trips in spite of the plane crash, and who seem determined to stay in spite of their governments’ security warnings.

A German visitor said: “We’ve been here for four or five days and we don’t see anything that makes us afraid, so we are totally relaxed. Everyone is nice here. I don’t see any terrorism here.”

An Italian visitor was equally unfazed: “We have been coming to Sharm el-Sheik for more than 20 years. Nothing like this has ever happened. The weather is very good, and we’re going to keep on coming. We Italians will always come here.”',

Operation Free Sinjar aims to cordon off the town, take control of Islamic State supply routes and establish a buffer zone to protect the town from artillery, a statement from the Kurdish national security council said.

Sinjar is a symbolic and strategic prize, sitting astride the main highway linking the cities of Mosul and Raqqa – Islamic State’s bastions in Iraq and Syria.

U.S.-led coalition air strikes pounded Islamic State-held areas in the town overnight, as around 7,500 Kurdish special forces, peshmerga and Yazidi fighters descended from the eponymous mountain towards the frontline in a military convoy.

Kurdish forces and the U.S. military said the number of Islamic State fighters in the town had increased to nearly 600 after reinforcements arrived in the run-up to the offensive, which has been expected for weeks but delayed by weather and friction between various Kurdish and Yazidi forces in Sinjar.

The offensive is being personally overseen by Kurdistan regional president Massoud Barzani, who is also head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which other groups in the area accuse of seeking to monopolise power.',

Many of the great sculptor’s works have been restored and supplemented by his remarkable collection of paintings, including works by Edvard Munch and Vincent Van Gogh, much of which is on show for the first time.

The renovation project was partly funded by the sale of bronzes casts from the artist’s original moulds as director Catherine Chevillot explains: “We are a rather unique case among French museums, we own the rights of the artist to continue to make original bronzes, within the legal limit of twelve pieces, so this has enabled us to partly fund the renovation work,” she says.

“Rodin, like all post-Renaissance sculptors, would start working with clay, he would model it. So the moulding is what records the artist’s original work. But these clay models are very rarely kept, they are destroyed when the artist makes a plaster cast of his work. So the plaster cast is the most faithful and the only remaining imprint of the artist’s work,” Catherine Chevillot explains.

With the number of sculptures created from original molds capped at twelve, the revenue stream is limited. Museum officials point out that works like ‘The Thinker’ have been cast the maximum number of times, but editions of ‘The Gates of Hell’ and ‘The Kiss’ remain available.',

One of the most beloved children’s novels of all time and still a best-seller after 72 years, it has seen various more or less successful adaptations over the years.

The pressure was on for film director Mark Osborne, who chose a very personal approach: “The Little Prince provided an opportunity to kind of look within and find a very personal story that I could tell, that would also celebrate this amazing piece of literature. I don’t think I ever thought about doing an adaptation before, and this one is an incredibly challenging adaptation, and that’s why I chose to do something that was sort of non-traditional and not a true adaptation, that is more of a tribute.”

Rather than follow the story of the book, the film tells it through the eyes of a little girl and her neighbour, an eccentric old aviator, who go on an adventure and find the Little Prince.

Five years in the making, the film required the work of hundreds of animation specialists divided into two teams: “From the very beginning, I knew that we were going to be combining CG (Computer Generated) animation and stop-motion animation. So once you go down that road, you are creating a very specific creative aesthetic problem, stop-motion has a very specific look because it’s physical objects photographed in front of a camera with real light so we wanted the CG to blend with that, we didn’t want to make the CG look like stop-motion, it had to have its own quality, but we used a lot of lighting techniques and atmosphere techniques in the CG to create a similar feel.”',

The images provided by the drone show elements that would otherwise go unseen, enabling Paetow to treat his field accordingly.

“These lighter spots on the picture show a mouse infestation,” he explains, pointing at the picture taken by the drone on a screen, “which you can control if you know exactly where the mice are. Here there is an area where these yellow spots indicate that there is a lice infestation. In the autumn, we didn’t treat this area against lice, and that’s why the damage shows there. On the rest of the field we were able to prevent further damage by treating it with insecticide. What also shows up here is a damp spot, which might require drainage, for example.”

“Who can I call when I need help? Where can I learn German? How do you apply for asylum? What happens when I apply? What documents do I need to bring? What questions are they going to ask? All these important things. And where can I turn when I need more information?,” were just some of the questions according to her.

The app gives refugees information on all of these things and more, like basic German law or where to get food. The aim is to make the information accessible to a newcomer who may be unfamiliar with a country’s customs, laws and regulations.

Ahmet Mohammed is a 25-year-old refugee from Aleppo: “It’s a very good app,” he says. “It contains a lot of information that is important to know for refugees who arrive here in Germany from Syria. The laws here in Germany are very different from the laws in Syria and this app contains a lot of information that will help refugees in their everyday life.”

Up until now, there were only three ways to drive a Ferarri Testarossa Spider.

The first was by climbing inside the bright red arcade cabinet for 1986 video game "Out Run," which had used its own version of the production road car.

The second was to order up a custom Testarossa from a bespoke conversion firm, sacrificing Ferrari''s recognition in the process.

The third was to be the Sultan of Brunei, who is said to have taken delivery of five off-the-record models, now part of the royal family''s expansive car collection.

But now, auction house Artcurial Motorcars has revealed that a fourth method existed all along, and it''s one that came with Ferrari''s stamp approval.

The Testarossa Spider wasn''t just a myth: Gianni Agnelli, head of Ferrari''s then-owner FIAT, had secretly commissioned his very own open-top version of the iconic supercar.

Painted silver, an element whose periodic notation AG is the inverse of Agnelli''s initials, the special Spider also houses a white stowaway roof, and sports a blue stripe above its black sills.

Over four nights in January, revelers will descend into the bowels of Paris’s underground canals, for what promises to be an epic and most unusual masquerade ball dubbed “Venice under Paris.”

The dress code is 18th century Venice: Think corsets, hoop skirts, gloves, wigs, lace and, of course, masks.

The transportation: gondolas.

And for entertainment, guests will be serenaded by musicians, entertained by theatrical performances, and given exclusive access to parts of Paris that are normally off-limits. Details on the exact location remain mum.

The ball, organized by a young event-planning group We Are the Oracle, has been a year and a half in the making and marks their biggest project to date.

The elite group is known for organizing exclusive events at unique venues that have included a municipal swimming pool, castle, underground war bunker and the catacombs of Paris.

Though organizers have received permission from the city, the event hinges on the sale of 2,000 tickets by November 16.

So far, half the tickets have been sold.

The Venetian event isn’t the only ball in town, however. Every summer, Chateau de Versailles is overrun by faux Marie Antoinettes and Louis XIVs. And this weekend marks the return of the annual Bal des Princesses at Salle Wagram near the Arc de Triomphe.',
